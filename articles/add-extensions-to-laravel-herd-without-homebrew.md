We've recently started using [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) on our development machines for most of our
projects.

Herd is a project that takes [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet), which we used for many years, and
wraps it up into a nice UI. In addition, Herd will install precompiled versions of PHP for you, whereas Valet depends on
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to compile PHP on your machine.

For all the benefits it brought the Mac ecosystem, we have experienced many instances where doing a Homebrew update
would cause other dependencies to break on our machines, leading to **hours or even days of lost productivity** to get
everything fixed and running again.

[Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sail) solves this problem by building all of your dependencies inside a
Docker container which won't be effected by Homebrew, however Sail can be quite heavy to get setup and can be overkill
on simple projects.

Herd gives us a different approach where PHP is precompiled, so you don't need to worry about compiling it yourself, or
dealing with Homebrew in general - it's largely just install Herd, and you're off to the races.

## Default extensions

Because Herd's PHP is precompiled, you only get access to a set of common extensions that are used in most projects.

You can see these if you install Herd, and then run `php -m`:

```

## The official way to add PHP extensions to Laravel Herd

For a recent talk I was working on, I wanted to parse email files (`.eml`) in realtime using Laravel, and to do that I
needed the [Mailparse](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mailparse.php) PHP extension.

The [Herd documentation](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/advanced-usage/additional-extensions) explains:

> You may add additional PHP extensions that are not included out of the box with Herd, by installing them via Homebrew
> and pecl.

This immediately gave me flashbacks to the dark days of yore, and I knew this wasn't how I wanted to get started with my
talk - dealing with not only installing Homebrew, then PHP, then running PECL, only to have it probably break right
before my talk ðŸ˜…

## The better way to add PHP extensions to Laravel Herd

I did some research, crawling through GitHub issues, until I found
this [amazing comment](https://github.com/beyondcode/herd-community/issues/145#issuecomment-1740752325)
by [SagarNaliyapara](https://github.com/SagarNaliyapara) on GitHub.

Thanks to Sagar's comment, I had now seen the light.

I had never heard of the [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) project before, but their mission is to create an
easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading open-source software on the Mac operating system - _and boy
have they done it!_

I went searching in their [huge list of packages](https://packages.macports.org/) (trust me there are a lot), and
using `Ctrl+F` sure enough I found the magical `php83-mailparse` that
I was looking for.

Clicking into [that directory](https://packages.macports.org/php83-mailparse/) I could see they had lots of variants for
different environments:

- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_10.i386.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_10.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_11.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_12.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_13.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_14.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_15.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_16.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_17.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_18.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_19.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_20.arm64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_20.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_21.arm64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_21.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_22.arm64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_22.x86_64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_23.arm64.tbz2`
- `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_23.x86_64.tbz2`

From this list, I could see that they only had the [latest version](https://pecl.php.net/package/mailparse) of
Mailparse, 3.1.6, which was perfect for what I needed.

Next I needed to determine my own environment, so that I knew which version to download. From the filenames, it looked
like I needed to determine two things:

- My "Darwin" version
- My architecture (`x86_64` or `arm64`)

Fortunately for us, Herd has done the hard work of getting PHP setup for our machine, so we can piggyback off it and get
both details with a simple command:

```bash
php -i | grep "Build System => "
```

Running that will give you an output that looks like this:

```text
Build System => Darwin oh-162-55-253-165 22.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 22.5.0: Mon Apr 24 20:53:44 PDT 2023; root:xnu-8796.121.2~5/RELEASE_ARM64_T8103 arm64
```

From this, we can see that for the precompiled version of PHP that we are running, our Darwin version is `22.5.0`, and
we are on an `arm64` architecture.

{% callout type="warning" title="Be careful" %}
Keep in mind you are downloading a library from the Internet and running it on your machine, so be sure that you're
comfortable with the risk associated with that.
{% /callout %}

I then downloaded the corresponding file, `php83-mailparse-3.1.6_0.darwin_22.arm64.tbz2`, and just using Finder I could
decompress the file to reveal the contents. I then just needed to locate the magical `mailparse.so` that I so
desperately needed.

```text

                â””â”€â”€ php83
                    â””â”€â”€ ~mailparse.ini

13 directories, 9 files
```

You can see the `mailparse.so` extension is contained inside `opt/local/lib/php83/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20230831`,
so I just went to that directory in Finder, and copied the extension file.

I then realised I wasn't sure what to do next.

### Where should we place it?

Typically, Homebrew will setup somewhere inside our `/opt/homebrew/lib/php` folder to store extensions, but since we
aren't using Homebrew, we don't have a place already established on our machine to store extensions.

Fortunately, PHP can load extensions from anywhere, so it's really up to you for where you want to put them.

I opted to just put the extension directly in the same folder as the Herd `php.ini` for this version of PHP, so that as
I switch between PHP versions, the extension is only enabled for the correctly compiled PHP version that it corresponds
to.

You can find that directory by running this command:

```bash
php --ini | grep "Additional .ini files parsed:"
```

That ended up being this path on my machine:

```text
/Users/mdavis/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/php/83/php.ini
```

I copied the `mailparse.so` from the compressed file we downloaded and uncompressed, and pasted it into the same folder
as the `php.ini` that Herd is reading, which in this case
was `/Users/mdavis/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/php/83/`.

If you're not able to navigate to that file in Finder, try using `Go > Go to Folder...` from the Finder menu bar, and
then paste in the path. You can also use Herd's `Open configuration files` menu bar item, and then navigate to the right
PHP version.

### Enabling the extension

I then opened the `php.ini` in this directory, and with a single line added at the end of the file, I was able to enable
the extension:

```text
extension=/Users/mdavis/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/php/83/mailparse.so
```

I was surprised to see that I didn't need to add double quotes around the path, despite the fact that it contained a
space.

Make sure you save the file, and you're all set.

I then **restarted PHP** from the Herd menu bar using `Stop all` and then `Start all`.

### Taking the extension out of quarantine

Immediately I was presented with a system popup telling me:

> "mailparse.so" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.

This is a protection built into macOS to stop you running executables from unknown (unsigned) developers.

{% callout type="warning" title="No really, be careful" %}
It's worth reiterating that you are trusting software from the Internet, which could do anything on your machine.

I trust the process at MacPorts, so I proceeded with the following.
{% /callout %}

You can get around it by taking the file out of quarantine with this command, importantly noting that **we do** need the
double quotes this time, and substituting in your own path to your extension:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Users/mdavis/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/php/83/mailparse.so"
```

I then **restarted PHP** from the Herd menu bar, again using `Stop all` and then `Start all`.

Now, when I run `php -m` to list our installed modules, I now see `mailparse` ðŸŽ‰

### This doesn't always work

If you **still** get issues with PHP being unable to load a dynamic library, it's possible that you are missing some
dependencies of the extension, in which case your mileage may vary. I was fortunate with the `mailparse` extension, but
in testing for this article I installed the `uuid` extension and found that it needed another library called `libuuid`.

[MacPorts should have](https://packages.macports.org/) the missing library for you, but at this point it does start to
get a bit tedious to find the right file, decompress, move, and unquarantine the file, so in this case you may actually
want to consider using Homebrew. I wish you luck!

## Finishing up

If you need to install PHP extensions beyond what Laravel Herd comes with out of the box, and don't want to deal with
dependency hell, I can strongly recommend using this method as **it just works**.

We are enormously thankful to the folks behind [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) for making this possible.
