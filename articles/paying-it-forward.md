I'm Mitchell, the founder of Atlas Software. Today, I want to share something close to our hearts â€“ our commitment to the open source community.

It's not just a corporate decision; it's a personal pledge from our team to the world of tech that constantly inspires and drives us.

Starting now, we're dedicating 2% of every client engagement to sponsor open source projects that not only benefit our clients but also resonate with our team's passion and values.

## The importance of open source

Open source isn't just code; it's a community we're proud to be part of. It's about working together, sharing ideas, and building something bigger than ourselves.

It's this spirit of collaboration and innovation that sparked the creation of Atlas Software, and it's what keeps us pushing boundaries every day.

## The impact of our contribution

Here's what our initiative really means:

- **Supporting the Tools We Love**: Our work in Laravel, Vue, and React Native wouldn't be the same without the open source tools we depend on. By funding these projects, we're not just giving back; we're ensuring they continue to grow and evolve with us.
- **Fostering a Community We Belong To**: This is about more than just writing checks. It's about supporting the meetups, conferences, and workshops that bring us together as developers and thinkers. It's where we learn, laugh, and brainstorm our next big idea.
- **Fueling Innovation That Excites Us**: We're always on the lookout for the next groundbreaking idea in tech. Supporting open source projects is our way of helping these ideas take flight, leading to new features and technologies that we get to explore and implement in our projects.

## How we choose projects to support

Picking the right projects is a personal journey. We look for initiatives that:

- Spark our team's interest and curiosity.
- Have a direct impact on the work we do for our clients.
- Share our ethos of innovation, collaboration, and community.

## Inviting our clients on this adventure

We believe in transparency and collaboration, not just in our projects but in our contributions too. We're excited to take our clients along on this adventure, keeping them in the loop about the projects we support and the collective impact we're making.

## Closing thoughts

This isn't just a company policy; it's a reflection of who we are at Atlas Software. By giving back to the open source community, we're not just saying thanks for the tools and technologies that power our work. We're also saying we believe in a future where technology is open, collaborative, and a little bit more human.

Thanks for being part of our journey. Here's to building not just great software but a great community, one project at a time.
